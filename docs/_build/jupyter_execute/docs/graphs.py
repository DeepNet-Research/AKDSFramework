# ## Graph representation with adjacency matrix
# Matrix representation of Graph
# ### Arguments:
# - `vertices` (int): Number of total vertices in the graph
# - `is_directed` (Bool): Expects directed or not directed graph. Defaults to not directed graph.
# 
# ### Space Complexity:
# Space complexity for graphs represented with adjacenecy matrix is $O(V^2)$ where $V$ is number of vertices. Use this method of representation only when your graph is dense. Number of edges $|E| â‰¥ V^2$ Else a lot of zeros will be placed inside the matrix which won't be that efficient space wise. For sparse matrix use `GraphDictionaryRepresented` instead of `GraphMatrixRepresented`.

# In[1]:


from AKDSFramework.structure.graph import GraphMatrixRepresented
import numpy as np

graph1 = GraphMatrixRepresented(vertices=10, is_directed=True)


# In[2]:


# Now add few edges with random weights
while graph1.number_of_edges < 100:
    random_start = np.random.randint(low=0, high=graph1.vertices)
    random_end = np.random.randint(low=0, high=graph1.vertices)
    random_weight = np.random.randint(-7, 20)
    if random_weight != 0 and graph1.show_graph()[random_start][random_end] == 0:
        graph1.add_edge_between(start=random_start, end=random_end, weight=random_weight)
        graph1.add_edge_between(start=random_start, end=random_end, weight=random_weight)
    else:
        pass


# Now showing edges and vertices and the matrix representation of the graph

# In[3]:


print(f"Total number of edges: {graph1.number_of_edges}")  # or print(graph1.count_edges())
print(f"Total vertices: {graph1.vertices}")
print(graph1.show_graph())


# ## Graph representation with adjacency lists
# If you have a sparse graph use `GraphDictionaryRepresented()` for representing graphs. This takes $O(E + V)$ space.
# Running BFS DFS will be faster in this structure for sparse represented graphs, that's why we implemented BFS DFS as a method in GraphDictionaryRepresented class.
# 
# ## Let's create a graph
# 
# Let's create a graph. To create graphs we need to create Vertex objects. We've made custom vertex objects because we need to store the neighbours and keep track of those guys.

# In[4]:


from AKDSFramework.structure.graph import Vertex
from AKDSFramework.structure.graph import GraphDictionaryRepresented


# In[5]:


g = GraphDictionaryRepresented()


# Now let's register few vertices:

# In[6]:


for i in range(1, 8):
    g.register_vertex(Vertex(f'{i}'))

print(f"Now we have {g.number_of_vertices} number of vertices")


# Using raw_dict you can see all the vertices and their neighbors

# In[7]:


print("Here is the dictionary containing all the vertices and it's neighbor")
g.raw_dict()


# As we've not registerd neighbor's and edges with the vertex all the neighbors are showing blank. Let's now add a few edges.

# In[8]:


edges = ['15', '14', '12', '27', '26', '23']
for edge in edges:
    g.register_edge(edge[:1], edge[1:], directed=False)


# Now let's have a look at the graph

# In[9]:


g.prettyprint()


# And the dictionary would look like

# In[10]:


g.raw_dict()


# That's our graph.
# ## BFS & DFS
# Let's run BFS and DFS algo on top of the graph to see results. We'll start from vertex number '1'

# In[11]:


print(g.BFS('1'))
print(g.DFS('1'))


# ## Visualize the graph
# You can also see how your graph looks. Either in a TD (Top down approach) or a LR(Left right view).

# In[12]:


from AKDSFramework.structure.graph import draw_graph
draw_graph(g, "TD")


# Left to right view of the same graph.

# In[13]:


draw_graph(g, "LR")
