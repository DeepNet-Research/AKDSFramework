# Linked List

AKDSFramework currently supports the singly linked list data structure, in future weâ€™ll add the circular and the doubly linked lists. When the installation done to use linked list just import the following code

```python
from AKDSFramework.structure import SinglyLinkedList
singlelinkedlist = SinglyLinkedList()
```

```python
# Now add a few nodes to the list
singlelinkedlist.add(2)
singlelinkedlist.add(49)
singlelinkedlist.add(82)
singlelinkedlist.add(21)
```
Now we need to be able to see how the linked list currently looks like. So to do that simply call `print()` method.
```
print(singlelinkedlist)
```
This will return `2 --> 49 --> 82 --> 21 --> None`
Now we have our linked list. Now we can do some operations on it. We currently support the following operations on linked lists.

| ID | Operation call method                 | What does it do?                                    |
|----|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | `.add()`                              | Add value at the very end.                          |
| 2  | `for _ in singlelinkedlist:`          | Iterates over the linked list                       |
| 3  | `.removeAt(index)`                    | Mention the index you want the value to be removed. |
| 4  | `.get_head()`                         | Get the head node value of the linked list          |
| 5  | `.count()` or `len(singlelinkedlist)` | Total number of element in the list                 |
| 6  | `.isEmpty()`                          | Returns True if list is empty                       |
| 7  | `reversed(singlelinkedlist)`          | Reverses the linked list                            |
| 8  | `singlelinkedlist[index]`             | Get the data at index = index                       |
| 9  | `.prettyprint()`                      | Not implemented yet                                 |
| 10 | `print(singlelinkedlist)`             | Prints the linked list in a nice format.            |
