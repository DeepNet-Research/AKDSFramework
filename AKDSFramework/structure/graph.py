class GraphMatrixRepresented:
    """
    Matrix representation of Graph
        Args:
            - ``vertices`` (int): Number of total vertices in the graph
            - ``is_directed`` (Bool): Expects directed or not directed graph. Defaults to not directed graph.

        Space Complexity:
            Space complexity for graphs represented with adjacenecy matrix is :math:`O(V^2)` where :math:`V` is number
            of vertices. Use this method of representation only when your graph is dense. Number of edges `:math:|E| â‰¥ V^2`
            Else a lot of zeros will be placed inside the matrix which won't be that efficient space wise. For sparse matrix
            use ``GraphDictionaryRepresented`` instead of ``GraphMatrixRepresented``.

        Examples::
            >>> from AKDSFramework.structure.graph import GraphMatrixRepresented
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> graph1 = GraphMatrixRepresented(vertices=20, is_directed=True)
            >>> # Now add few edges with random weights
            >>> while graph1.number_of_edges < 100:

            >>>     random_weight = np.random.randint(-7, 20)
